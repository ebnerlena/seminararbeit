Immersive technologies and use cases for interactive data analysis in immersive environments are rapidly growing. Meaning there is a growing demand of new design space interaction techniques that allow an intuitive and effective interaction with abstract 3D data. This paper is supposed to analyse and evaluate already existing possibilities for immersive visualisation interaction starting with different setups. I will then analyze interaction techniques that potentially can be as effective in 3D space as mouse and keyboard interaction techniques in 2D space. Typically there are four types of interaction issues in 3D space: Navigation, Selection & Manipulation, Movement and System Control, which I will be referring to. To conclude the paper I will present some Open-Source tool-kits and examples for immersive visualisation and how they try to overcome interaction issues.
